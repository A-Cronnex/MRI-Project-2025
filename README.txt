## Abstract
In 2013, the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) organized the Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) Project. The project determined the unified imaging protocol on 28th February 2014 (https://bicr.atr.jp/rs-fmri-protocol-2/) and have collected multisite resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data using fourteen scanners across eight research institutes for the last five years. The collected dataset encompasses 2,239 participants and five disorders and is publicly shared through the SRPBS multisite multi-disorder database (https://bicr-resource.atr.jp/decnefpro/). We also collected traveling-subject rs-fMRI dataset to estimate measurement bias in each imaging site. 

Here we released the 3T MRI imaging dataset from 1,410 participants who agreed to unrestricted release with NIFTI format:
- resting-state fMRI EPI images (func)
- defaced T1w image (anat)
- fieldmap (fmap, optional)
